# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project creates a very basic website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements.
The website contains an about me page that details a little information about me,
a QUnit page that displays the status of the tests run, and some JavaScript code
that used for displaying an alert and running the tests.

To run the website:

From within the project directory run the following commands:

`npm install`

Once the modules have been installed, you can open the project using:

`code .`

Open "index.html" from the file explorer window and use the
Visual Studio Code command palette (F1) to run the Live Preview Server.
